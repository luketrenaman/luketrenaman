### Hello, I'm Luke Trenaman
Welcome to my **epic** Github profile.

If you're interested in trying out some of my projects, head over to my website, [luketrenaman.com](https://luketrenaman.com/)

For developers, you're able to find 3 kinds of repos on my profile:
- 🌐 **Web applications** (HTML, CSS, JS, React)
- 🎮 **Games** (Canvas, Pixi.JS, more recently Godot)
- 📊 **Competitive programming repos** (hackathon prototypes, quickly written algorithms)

I'm currently working on:
- 🎓 Getting my degree
- 🎮 Some smaller projects with Godot

Contact me by email if:
